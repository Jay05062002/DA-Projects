## Coffee Sales Data Analysis:

### Understanding the Data :
This analysis starts by loading the coffee sales data from a CSV file. Before diving into any insights, the dataset is checked for missing values and formatting issues. One of the most important steps is fixing the datetime column, ensuring that dates and times are in the correct format. This is essential for tracking how sales change over different periods.

### Finding the Most Popular Coffee:
To see which coffee sells the most, the data is analyzed to count how often each type is purchased. This gives a clear picture of customer favorites and helps identify which drinks are the best sellers. In addition, payment methods are examined to see whether people prefer paying with cash or a card, which can be useful for making business decisions like adjusting payment options.
When Do People Buy Coffee?
Sales don’t happen evenly throughout the day or week. Sales are broken down by months, days of the week, and even hours to determine the busiest times. This helps answer questions like: Are weekends busier than weekdays? Do sales peak in the morning or later in the day? Does coffee demand change with the seasons?

### Which Coffees Make the Most Money?
Beyond just knowing what sells the most, it’s important to see which products generate the highest revenue. The total earnings for each coffee type are calculated to find out which drinks bring in the most money. Monthly sales trends are also reviewed to check if there are seasonal patterns that affect revenue.

### Visualizing Sales Trends:
To make all this data easier to understand, different charts and graphs are created. Bar charts show which coffee types earn the most, line graphs track sales trends over time, and histograms display how people prefer to pay. These visuals help highlight important patterns and make the findings more intuitive.

### Key Insights for Business Decisions:
This analysis provides useful takeaways for improving sales and operations. Knowing which coffees are most profitable helps in making better pricing and marketing decisions. Understanding peak sales hours allows for better staff scheduling, ensuring enough employees are available during busy times. Recognizing seasonal demand shifts also helps in stocking the right amount of inventory.

### Conclusion:
By using data to understand coffee sales, businesses can make smarter decisions that improve efficiency, increase revenue, and enhance customer satisfaction. This analysis offers a clearer picture of what’s happening behind the numbers and how to use those insights to run a more successful coffee shop.

## Customer Satisfaction Prediction
### Overview:
This project aims to analyze customer support tickets and predict customer satisfaction levels using machine learning techniques. By leveraging data preprocessing, feature extraction, and predictive modeling, the project provides insights into customer experience, helping businesses improve support services.

### Project Workflow:
Data Collection: Loads customer support ticket data from a CSV file.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes patterns and trends in the data.
Preprocessing: Handles missing values, converts text into numerical features, and prepares data for machine learning.
Feature Engineering: Uses text vectorization techniques to extract meaningful insights.
Model Training: Implements various machine learning models, such as:
Linear Regression to predict customer satisfaction scores.
K-Means Clustering to group similar customers based on their support interactions.
Evaluation & Optimization: Uses Mean Squared Error (MSE) and other performance metrics to evaluate model effectiveness.
Insights & Visualization: Generates graphs and reports to highlight key findings.

### Technologies Used:
The project is implemented using Python and the following libraries:
pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation and analysis
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
Scikit-learn – Machine learning models and evaluation
CountVectorizer – Text feature extraction

### Conclusion:
The model helps in identifying key factors influencing customer satisfaction.
Businesses can use this predictive analysis to optimize their support services and improve customer experience.
Visualization graphs provide meaningful trends, such as the relationship between response time and satisfaction levels.

### Future Improvements:
Implementing advanced NLP techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings for better text feature extraction.
Exploring deep learning models like LSTMs for improved predictions.
Integrating real-time customer feedback analysis with sentiment analysis.
