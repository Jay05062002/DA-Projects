Coffee Sales Data Analysis:

Understanding the Data :
This analysis starts by loading the coffee sales data from a CSV file. Before diving into any insights, the dataset is checked for missing values and formatting issues. One of the most important steps is fixing the datetime column, ensuring that dates and times are in the correct format. This is essential for tracking how sales change over different periods.

Finding the Most Popular Coffee:
To see which coffee sells the most, the data is analyzed to count how often each type is purchased. This gives a clear picture of customer favorites and helps identify which drinks are the best sellers. In addition, payment methods are examined to see whether people prefer paying with cash or a card, which can be useful for making business decisions like adjusting payment options.
When Do People Buy Coffee?
Sales don’t happen evenly throughout the day or week. Sales are broken down by months, days of the week, and even hours to determine the busiest times. This helps answer questions like: Are weekends busier than weekdays? Do sales peak in the morning or later in the day? Does coffee demand change with the seasons?

Which Coffees Make the Most Money?
Beyond just knowing what sells the most, it’s important to see which products generate the highest revenue. The total earnings for each coffee type are calculated to find out which drinks bring in the most money. Monthly sales trends are also reviewed to check if there are seasonal patterns that affect revenue.

Visualizing Sales Trends
To make all this data easier to understand, different charts and graphs are created. Bar charts show which coffee types earn the most, line graphs track sales trends over time, and histograms display how people prefer to pay. These visuals help highlight important patterns and make the findings more intuitive.

Key Insights for Business Decisions
This analysis provides useful takeaways for improving sales and operations. Knowing which coffees are most profitable helps in making better pricing and marketing decisions. Understanding peak sales hours allows for better staff scheduling, ensuring enough employees are available during busy times. Recognizing seasonal demand shifts also helps in stocking the right amount of inventory.

Conclusion:
By using data to understand coffee sales, businesses can make smarter decisions that improve efficiency, increase revenue, and enhance customer satisfaction. This analysis offers a clearer picture of what’s happening behind the numbers and how to use those insights to run a more successful coffee shop.
